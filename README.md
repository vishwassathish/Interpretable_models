* jupyter notebook files contains the notebook on which we have done our analysis. If jupyter notebook is available in your system, upload "log_regression.ipynb" and run it as a notebook.

* This file also has the markdown and html format of the notebook, which can only be used to view the code snippets and their corresponding outputs.

* "graphs" contains the final graphs for each kind of analysis 
	1. Weight analysis
	2. Weight * Value analysis
	3. Lime analysis

* READ THE TEXT FILE "./codes/Instructions_to_run_files" to find out how to run files and obtain explanations/graphs.
